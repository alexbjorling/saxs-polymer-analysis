# README #

This code simulates a simple explicit polymer model with various energy terms.

### Contents ###

* A class representing a collection of chains, with methods for perturbing the structure and checking its energy.
* A script that runs a Monte Carlo simulation of such an object.
* A VMD script for visualizing the resulting trajectory.

### Documentation ###

The underlying model is described in detail in the NXUS report for Statens Serum Institut (www.nxus.dk).

This folder contains the code to generate the publication-ready figures, indcluding the procedures for simulating chains and calculating their model scattering.

Actual simulated trajectories are not included since they take some space, but python scripts for plotting fits and vmd/tcl scripts for making the graphical cartoons are included, as well as the finished images for convenience.
